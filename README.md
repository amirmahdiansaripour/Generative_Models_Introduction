# Generative_Models_Introduction

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): 

The model has two subnetworks, a discriminator and a generator: 

### Discriminator: 

It tries to distinguish between images belonging to the dataset and those produced by the generator. It does so by giving $D_\theta$, which lies between 0 and 1. The more $D_\theta$ is closed to one, the more the discriminator has detected that the input images are from the dataset.
